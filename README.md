## Setup/Install
```
git clone https://github.com/Naitry/Blu/
cd ./Blu/
pip install -e ./
```

## Current TODO
- Incorporate a basic benchmark simulation which records how quickly a standard sim is being processed, this should also log the performace and the current revision to a log file that will be used to document performace gain over the course of the application
- Implement the evolution of vector values fields, this will require either the implementation of the Dirac or Pauli equation, though I would like to prioritize vector bosons
